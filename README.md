This is a custom integration for Home Assistant that connects to a Homevolt Energy Management System (EMS) locally and provides comprehensive sensor data for monitoring your energy system.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track your Homevolt system status in real-time
- **Battery Monitoring**: Monitor battery levels with dynamic icons
- **Energy Flow**: Track energy consumption, production, and storage
- **Multi-Device Support**: Support for multiple EMS devices and sensors
- **Schedule Management**: View and manage charging/discharging schedules
- **Error Detection**: Display error and warning information when available
- **Local Polling**: All communication is local, no cloud dependency
- **Easy Configuration**: Configurable through the Home Assistant UI

## Supported Sensors

The integration provides various sensor types including:

- Battery state and level
- Power consumption and generation
- Energy management system status
- Inverter information
- Battery management system data
- Voltage and current readings
- Temperature monitoring
- Schedule information

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Make sure [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed in your Home Assistant instance
2. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS:
   - Go to HACS > Integrations
   - Click the three dots in the top right corner
   - Select "Custom repositories"
   - Add the URL of this repository and select "Integration" as the category
3. Click "Install" on the Homevolt Local integration
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/homevolt_local` directory to your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

1. Go to Settings > Devices & Services
2. Click "Add Integration"
3. Search for "Homevolt Local"
4. Follow the configuration steps:
   - Enter the IP address or hostname of your first Homevolt system
   - Enter your username and password
   - Configure optional settings (SSL verification, scan interval, timeout)
   - Add additional IP addresses for linked systems (optional)
   - Select which system should be considered the main system (if you added multiple)
   - Confirm the configuration

### Multiple IP Addresses

If your Homevolt system has multiple IP addresses (for example, if you have multiple controllers that are linked together), you can now add all IP addresses during the initial setup process. This creates a single integration instance that manages all your linked systems.

Benefits of this approach:
- All systems are managed by a single integration instance
- Data from all systems is merged automatically
- Duplicate devices and sensors are automatically detected and prevented
- You can designate one system as the "main system" which will be used as the primary data source

During setup, you'll be guided through:
1. Adding your first system (IP/hostname, credentials, and settings)
2. Adding additional systems one by one (with an option to add more after each)
3. Selecting which system should be considered the main system
4. Confirming the final configuration

The integration uses unique identifiers for each device based on their internal IDs, ensuring that the same physical device is represented only once in Home Assistant, regardless of which IP address it's accessed through.

## Devices and Sensors

This integration detects and creates separate devices for each Energy Management System (EMS) unit and sensor found in your Homevolt Local system. Each device has its own set of sensors, and there are also aggregated sensors that show combined data from all devices.

### Aggregated Sensors

These sensors show combined data from all EMS units:

1. **Homevolt Status**: Shows the current state of the EMS with a dynamic icon that changes based on the battery level
2. **Homevolt Error**: Shows error information when available
3. **Homevolt Total SoC**: Shows the total state of charge as a percentage
4. **Homevolt Power**: Shows the current power in watts
5. **Homevolt Energy Produced**: Shows the energy produced in kilowatt-hours
6. **Homevolt Energy Consumed**: Shows the energy consumed in kilowatt-hours

### EMS Device-Specific Sensors

Each EMS device will have the following sensors:

1. **Homevolt battery SoC**: Shows the state of charge for the battery as a percentage
2. **Status**: Shows the current state of the specific EMS device
3. **Power**: Shows the power of the specific EMS device in watts
4. **Energy Produced**: Shows the energy produced by the specific EMS device in kilowatts
5. **Energy Consumed**: Shows the energy consumed by the specific EMS device in kilowatts
6. **Error**: Shows error information specific to the device when available

### Sensor Devices

The integration also creates separate devices for each sensor in the system:

#### Grid Sensor

The Grid sensor device provides information about the power flow to and from the grid:

1. **Power**: Shows the current power flow in watts (positive for import, negative for export)
2. **Energy Imported**: Shows the total energy imported from the grid in kilowatt-hours
3. **Energy Exported**: Shows the total energy exported to the grid in kilowatt-hours

#### Solar Sensor

The Solar sensor device provides information about your solar production:

1. **Power**: Shows the current solar power production in watts
2. **Energy Imported**: Shows the total energy imported from the solar system in kilowatt-hours
3. **Energy Exported**: Shows the total energy exported to the solar system in kilowatt-hours

#### Load Sensor

The Load sensor device provides information about your household consumption:

1. **Power**: Shows the current power consumption in watts
2. **Energy Imported**: Shows the total energy imported by the loads in kilowatt-hours
3. **Energy Exported**: Shows the total energy exported by the loads in kilowatt-hours

## Example Dashboard

Here is an example dashboard configuration that you can use to display your Homevolt sensors. You can add this to your Home Assistant Dashboards by choosing "Raw configuration editor" and pasting the code below.

**Note:** You will likely need to replace some of the placeholder entity IDs (e.g., `sensor.REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_GRID_POWER_SENSOR`) with the actual entity IDs from your Home Assistant instance. You can find the entity IDs in Home Assistant under **Settings -> Devices & Services -> Entities**.

The aggregated sensors (e.g., `sensor.homevolt_total_soc`) should have stable entity IDs. However, sensors for Grid, Solar, Load, and individual EMS units may have entity IDs that vary depending on your setup (e.g., `sensor.power_2`, `sensor.power_3`). Please verify all entity IDs before using this dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Timeout**: Ensure your Homevolt system is accessible from Home Assistant
2. **Authentication Failed**: Verify username and password if required
3. **No Data**: Check that the EMS resource path is correct
4. **SSL Errors**: Try disabling SSL verification if using self-signed certificates

### Debug Logging

Enable debug from the dot menu.
